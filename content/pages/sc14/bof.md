The PyHPC Birds of a Feather session has been hosted at the Supercomputing conference for several years.  This page is here to capture some of the outputs from the sessions.


## Format

The PyHPC BoF takes the format of many lightning talks followed by a discussion
on the Python ecosystem in HPC.  Each lightning talk is roughly 5 minutes of
time for a presenter to show off anything related to Python and HPC.  Please
